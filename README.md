## Getting Started

This is a task-scheduler simulator coded to the "Operational Systems" class in Feevale University!! 

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
  - `classes`: this folder is being used to store all the helper classes that we will need on our App.java
  - `process_files`: this folder is being used to store all the files which abstract the creation of processes on the scheduler simulator

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## How to run (VSCode tutorial)
- git clone this repository
- install the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) extension in your vscode
